# To setup

1. Go to desired development directory `mkdir server`, then `cd server`

2. To download, while in server, run `git clone https://github.com/tommydmcdonald/Stock-Crypto-Tracker.git`

3. All node modules should have downloaded, but doesn't hurt to run `npm install` to double check

# To start both React and Express server

Run in server directory `npm run dev`

React Server route `localhost://3000`

Express server route `localhost://5000`
